To launch the project you need:

1. pull the docker container from cmd
      
2. run the docker-compose.yml file (running the docker container)

3. run the main class in Server project

4. when in the server console will appear a table with datas, run the main class from Client project


I inplemented the following options for a client to use:

           SelectAllColumnNames
displays names of the columns

           SelectColumn <column_name> 
displays all not null cells from column <column_name>

           SelectFromColumn <column_name> <search_for>
displays all cells from column <column_name>, that contains the key word <search_for>

           SelectRow <row_index>
displays all data of a person from row <row_index>

           SelectRowWith <search_for>
displays all information about the person, where any cell in this row contains a keyword <search_for>
           
           Exit
end the both programs: client and the server
